\section*{Preface}

This project has been ressurected twice, and thus this version might be thought
of as Project Euler 1.2. One main difference is that the codebase is now avaible
on Github:

\begin{center}
  \url{https://github.com/Oisov/Project-Euler}.
\end{center}
%
Another major change is the addition of several other programming languages,
with the most prominent being \textbf{Julia}. The code in these notes are now
written in Julia as it closely resembles psudocode, with just a few minor
changes.
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The logical expressions $\|\|, \&\&, !$ has been replaced with
          \textsc{OR}, \textsc{AND}, \textsc{NOT}
    \item Variable declaration is changed from $=$ to $\rightarrow$
    \item Variable comparison $==$ is changed to $=$
    \item The $+=$ syntax used to represent increasing a variable is replaced
    with $\uparrow$
\end{enumerate}
%
What has \emph{not} changed is the purpose of this document. The goal is still
to present well written, clever and interesting solutons to Project Euler.

I have seen too many hastily written solutions to these problems. While the
solutions work, they are not written in a clear matter, single letter
variablenames and no function declarations. Code like this is incredibly hard to
read for someone who has not produced the mess, and even for the author the code
can be incomprehensible after just a few weeks.

While I can not hope to remedy every badly written code with these notes,
hopefully someone who reads these notes, or browses the github repo finds some
inspiration.
